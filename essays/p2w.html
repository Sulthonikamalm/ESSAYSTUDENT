            <p class="reveal-text">Video games have grown into an important part of digital culture, and today they
                serve not only as entertainment but also as subjects of academic study. One interesting aspect to
                examine is the <span class="term-tooltip"
                    data-tip="Spending real money for unfair in-game advantages">Pay-to-Win (P2W)</span> system. The
                Pay-to-Win (P2W) system is a monetization mechanism in video games where players can use real money to
                gain competitive advantages, such as stronger weapons, faster access to content, or ability upgrades
                that directly influence game outcomes (Hamari et al., 2017). Some people argue that this system is
                beneficial because it provides revenue for developers and helps new players progress more quickly
                without spending a long time farming (Lehdonvirta, 2009). However, others believe that this system harms
                fairness and negatively affects the overall gameplay experience. In this context, I tend to agree with
                those who oppose the P2W system, because the negative impact on game balance is more significant
                compared to the benefits it offers from a player’s perspective. Although the Pay-to-Win system provides
                financial stability for developers and offers convenience for beginners who can afford to pay, its
                widespread use also carries the risk of creating a game environment that lacks fairness. This shows that
                financial profit alone is not enough without proper game design that maintains balance and ensures fair
                competition.</p>

            <p class="reveal-text">Overall, the P2W system is not entirely negative, as it offers several benefits for
                both developers and certain groups of players. For developers, P2W serves as a stable source of revenue,
                especially for free-to-play games that do not generate profit from initial sales. Through in-game
                transactions, developers can cover operational costs such as server maintenance, bug fixes, security
                improvements, and customer support. This revenue also enables them to release regular updates, seasonal
                events, and new content, keeping the game engaging and competitive. From the players’ perspective, P2W
                provides convenience for beginners to progress more quickly without spending excessive time <span
                    class="term-tooltip" data-tip="Spending time doing repetitive tasks to progress">grinding</span>.
                The system also offers flexibility by allowing players to customize their playstyle through character
                upgrades or faster access to exclusive content. Some players even feel personal satisfaction from making
                such purchases, as it allows them to shape their gameplay experience according to their preferences.
                Therefore, despite frequent criticism, P2W continues to hold appeal and remains implemented in many
                popular games today.</p>

            <div class="pull-quote reveal-text">
                <p>“Financial profit alone is not enough without proper game design that maintains balance and ensures
                    fair competition.”</p>
            </div>

            <p class="reveal-text">While the Pay-to-Win system offers some benefits, it also brings various problems and
                risks that can negatively affect the overall gameplay experience. One of the most obvious impacts is the
                <span class="highlight-hover">creation of unfair competition between players.</span> In P2W games,
                paying players usually have stronger weapons or certain advantages that make them significantly more
                powerful than those who do not spend money. As a result, non-paying players often feel frustrated and
                left behind, even when they actually possess good skills. This situation frequently leads many players
                to stop playing, which eventually decreases the number of active players and can damage the game's
                reputation. Furthermore, player skill becomes less meaningful because victories are often determined by
                how much money a player spends rather than by effort or strategy (Zendle et al., 2020).</p>

            <p class="reveal-text">To understand how players actually perceive this unfairness, I referred to an article
                titled “Pay to Win or Pay to Cheat: How Players of Competitive Online Games Perceive Fairness of In-Game
                Purchases.” The study, conducted by Guo, Wu, Nower, and Wohn, analyzed thousands of player posts taken
                from public Reddit data, where many players actively share their experiences and opinions about
                competitive games. Their findings show that 29.47% of the posts express that players still feel the
                gameplay is fair or balanced even when paid features are involved. However, a nearly identical
                percentage 29.98% reflects dissatisfaction with the fairness of the game, especially when in-game
                purchases influence match outcomes. In total, the study examined 2,685 posts and comments, which served
                as the main dataset for further analysis (Freeman et al., 2022). These results reinforce the idea that
                while some players may not mind the P2W system, many others feel that it disrupts balance and reduces
                the overall enjoyment of playing.</p>

            <p class="reveal-text">Although the P2W system has various negative aspects that can potentially damage the
                gameplay experience, this does not mean that the system cannot be improved. Instead, this situation
                emphasizes the importance of efforts by game developers to create balance so that the game remains fair,
                competitive, and enjoyable for all players, both paying and non-paying. To achieve this goal, the
                implementation of paid features must be carefully designed so they do not provide excessive advantages
                that could disrupt competition within the game. Developers need to ensure that all players still have a
                reasonable opportunity to compete without facing extreme power gaps (Hamari et al., 2017). In addition,
                developers must actively listen to feedback from the player community to understand how the P2W system
                affects their gameplay experience. By taking this feedback into account, developers can make the
                necessary adjustments and updates to maintain overall game balance.</p>

            <p class="reveal-text">In conclusion, the Pay-to-Win system has both advantages and disadvantages, but its
                impact on fairness and competitive balance remains a major concern. Although monetization supports
                developers and provides convenience for new players, it also risks creating a game environment where
                money has more influence than player skill. Therefore, developers must prioritize balanced game design
                to maintain fairness and preserve player satisfaction.</p>
