                Hello!</p>

            <div style="font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif; font-size: 1.15rem; line-height: 1.9; color: #444;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
                    Hi everyone! Let me introduce myself. My name is <strong
                        style="color: #000; font-weight: 600;">Meisya Ma’rifa Nur</strong>, and one of the most
                    interesting things about me is my love for watching movies. For me, they are more than just
                    entertainment; they are a way to explore new ideas. Among many genres, the one I like the most is
                    <em
                        style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; color: #DC0000; font-size: 1.25rem;">thriller</em>.
                    Thriller movies are very exciting because they are full of tension, mystery, and surprises. I love
                    how they make me curious and keep me thinking about what will happen next. Sometimes I even try to
                    guess the ending, but the twists usually surprise me in a good way.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
                    Watching thrillers is not only fun but also useful. This genre often shows interesting sides of
                    human behavior, trust, and choices in difficult situations. It makes me think more carefully and pay
                    attention to small details. For example, psychological thrillers make me try to understand the
                    characters’ minds, while crime thrillers let me imagine how detectives solve complex cases.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That is why I want to persuade you to watch thriller movies too. You do not need any special skills,
                    only curiosity and an open mind. It can be a great way to enjoy your free time, and at the same
                    time, you may learn something new about people and life. In the future, I plan to watch more
                    thriller films from different countries and maybe share some recommendations with friends. I believe
                    this hobby can bring not only fun but also a fresh perspective to anyone who tries it.
