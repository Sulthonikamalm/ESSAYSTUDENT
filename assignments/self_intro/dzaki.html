                Hello!</p>

            <div style="font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif; font-size: 1.15rem; line-height: 1.9; color: #444;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
                    My name is <strong style="color: #000; font-weight: 600;">Ahmad Dzaki Zayyan Sugianto</strong>, and
                    I am usually called Dzaki. I am currently 20 years old. I am from Bangkalan, Madura, but now I live
                    in Surabaya to continue my education. In between my college activities, I have several hobbies that
                    I enjoy. One of them is playing games, which I think can be a means of entertainment as well as
                    training in strategy and cooperation. In addition, I also occasionally watch movies to fill my free
                    time and get inspiration from the stories and visuals presented.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
                    I am currently an active student at Telkom University, majoring in Information Technology. There are
                    several reasons why I chose Telkom University as the place to continue my education. One of them is
                    because Telkom University has the latest, modern curriculum that is relevant to the needs of the
                    digital world today. I believe that by following this curriculum, I can acquire the knowledge and
                    skills needed to compete in the professional world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another reason I chose to major in Information Technology is because I have a great interest in
                    technology, especially in the field of web development. I want to become a reliable <em
                        style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; color: #DC0000; font-size: 1.25rem;">web
                        developer</em> who is capable of creating useful applications or websites for the community. In
                    my opinion, the world of the web is currently growing rapidly and will always be needed in various
                    aspects of life, starting from education, business, to public services. Therefore, I consider web
                    development as a promising field with broad opportunities in the future. Through my studies in
                    Information Technology, I hope to deepen my understanding of programming, system development, and
                    problem-solving skills that are essential in building high-quality web-based solutions.
