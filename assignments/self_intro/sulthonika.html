                Hello!</p>

            <div style="font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif; font-size: 1.15rem; line-height: 1.9; color: #444;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
                    My name is <strong style="color: #000; font-weight: 600;">Sulthonika Mahfudz Al Mujahidin</strong>,
                    and I am a university student who loves both technology and simple routines in daily life. One of
                    the things that makes my days interesting is how I mix my studies with my personal hobbies. For
                    example, I enjoy reading books about self-development, and one of my favorites is <em
                        style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; color: #DC0000; font-size: 1.25rem;">Filosofi
                        Teras</em>. This book teaches me about staying calm and focusing only on what I can control. I
                    believe this idea is useful for everyone, especially students who often feel stressed with deadlines
                    and exams.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another part of my life that I find meaningful is learning English. Recently, I started a personal
                    challenge to record short videos in English for thirty days. It is not easy, but it makes me more
                    confident day by day. I want to persuade you to try something similar. You do not need to choose
                    English if you do not want to, but try to pick a small challenge that can grow your skills step by
                    step. Maybe it is cooking, maybe it is drawing, or maybe it is learning a musical instrument. When
                    you challenge yourself, life feels more exciting, and you start to see progress that makes you
                    proud. My future plan is to continue combining my love for technology with communication skills, so
                    one day I can work internationally. I hope my story encourages you to find your own challenge and
                    start your own journey.
